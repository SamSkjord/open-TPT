## [v0.12] - 2025-11-22

### I2C Bus Reliability Fix 🔧

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **I2C bus contention resolved** - Added threading lock to serialise access between smbus2 and busio libraries
  - Both libraries access the same physical I2C bus (bus 1)
  - Without synchronisation, partial transactions could leave devices in bad states
  - Pico thermal sensors (via smbus2) and MLX90614/ADS1115 (via busio) now properly serialised
  - Prevents I2C bus lockups that required power cycling to recover

- **Pico firmware v1.1** - Improved I2C slave reliability (pico-tyre-temp repo)
  - Minimal critical section - pre-calculate all values before disabling interrupts
  - Reduced interrupt-disabled time from ~100µs to <10µs
  - Prevents NACKs when Pi polls during register updates (root cause of intermittent reads)
  - Added 5-second watchdog timer for automatic hang recovery

- **I2C mux hardware reset** - GPIO-controlled recovery for TCA9548A
  - Connect TCA9548A RESET pin to GPIO17 for hardware-level recovery
  - Auto-triggers after 3 consecutive I2C read failures
  - Uses Pi's internal pull-up resistor (no external components needed)
  - Logs reset events for debugging

- **Stale data caching for heatmaps** - Prevents display flashing
  - Display runs at 35 FPS but thermal/brake data updates at 7-10 Hz
  - Previously showed grey "offline" state when no fresh data available
  - Now caches last valid data for up to 1 second (configurable via `THERMAL_STALE_TIMEOUT`)
  - Applies to both thermal heatmaps and brake temperature displays
  - Smooth display even during brief sensor read delays

- **Exponential backoff for failed sensors** - Prevents I2C bus hammering
  - Missing/failed sensors no longer spam the I2C bus with constant read attempts
  - Backoff starts at 1s, doubles each failure (1s → 2s → 4s → ... → 64s max)
  - Logs only at key intervals (1, 3, 10, 50, then every 100 failures)
  - Resets immediately on successful read with recovery message
  - Prevents bus lockups when sensors are disconnected or not yet installed

#### 🔄 Modified Files

- `hardware/unified_corner_handler.py`
  - Added `threading` import
  - Added `self._i2c_lock = threading.Lock()` in `__init__`
  - Wrapped all I2C operations with `with self._i2c_lock:` context manager
  - Protected methods: `_read_pico_sensor`, `_read_tyre_mlx90614`, `_read_brake_adc`, `_read_brake_mlx90614`

- `main.py`
  - Added `THERMAL_STALE_TIMEOUT` import from config
  - Added `_thermal_cache` and `_brake_cache` dicts for stale data caching
  - Modified render loop to use cached data when fresh data unavailable

- `utils/config.py`
  - Added `THERMAL_STALE_TIMEOUT = 1.0` setting

#### 🔧 Technical Details

**Root Cause:**
The unified corner handler used two different I2C libraries:
- `smbus2` - For Pico thermal sensor communication (custom I2C slave)
- `busio` (Adafruit) - For MLX90614 and ADS1115 sensors

Both libraries accessed I2C bus 1 without synchronisation. When one library was mid-transaction and the other attempted access, partial transactions could corrupt the bus state, causing devices (particularly the Pico) to hold SDA low indefinitely.

**Solution:**
A `threading.Lock()` now ensures only one I2C transaction occurs at a time, preventing bus contention.

#### 🧪 Testing

- ✅ I2C bus no longer locks up during extended operation
- ✅ All sensors continue to read correctly
- ✅ Soak testing in progress

## [v0.11] - 2025-11-21

### Brake Temperature Emissivity Correction 🌡️

#### ✅ New Features
- **Automatic emissivity correction** - Software compensation for IR sensor readings
- **Per-corner emissivity configuration** - Adjust values to match rotor materials
- **Stefan-Boltzmann correction** - Accurate temperature calculation: `T_actual = T_measured / ε^0.25`
- **Material-specific defaults** - Pre-configured for oxidised cast iron (ε = 0.95)

#### 📝 Overview

All IR sensors (MLX90614 and ADC-based) have factory default emissivity of 1.0, assuming a perfect black body. Since brake rotors have lower emissivity (typically 0.95 for oxidised cast iron), sensors read lower than actual temperature. This update adds automatic software correction to compensate.

**How it works:**
1. MLX90614/IR sensor operates at factory default ε = 1.0 (not changed in hardware)
2. Actual brake rotor has lower emissivity (configurable per corner)
3. Sensor reads lower than actual due to less radiation from non-black-body surface
4. Software correction adjusts reading upward using Stefan-Boltzmann law

#### 🔄 Modified Files

- `utils/config.py` - Added emissivity configuration and correction function
  - New function: `apply_emissivity_correction()` (lines 148-187)
  - New config: `BRAKE_ROTOR_EMISSIVITY` dictionary (lines 469-496)
  - Comprehensive documentation of emissivity values for different materials
- `hardware/unified_corner_handler.py` - Applied correction to brake sensors
  - MLX90614 brake sensors: Lines 470-504 with emissivity correction
  - ADC brake sensors: Lines 443-468 with emissivity correction
  - Added detailed docstrings explaining correction process

#### ⚙️ Configuration

**Brake Rotor Emissivity** (in `utils/config.py`):
```python
BRAKE_ROTOR_EMISSIVITY = {
    "FL": 0.95,  # Front Left - typical oxidised cast iron
    "FR": 0.95,  # Front Right
    "RL": 0.95,  # Rear Left
    "RR": 0.95,  # Rear Right
}
```

**Typical rotor emissivity values:**
- Cast iron (rusty/oxidised): **0.95** (default, most common)
- Cast iron (machined/clean): 0.60-0.70
- Steel (oxidised): 0.80
- Steel (polished): 0.15-0.25
- Ceramic composite: 0.90-0.95

#### 🔧 Technical Details

**Correction Formula:**
```
T_actual (K) = T_measured (K) / ε^0.25
```

**Example:** If MLX90614 reads 295°C and rotor has ε = 0.95:
- Sensor assumes ε = 1.0 (factory default)
- Correction: 568.15 K / 0.95^0.25 = 575.17 K
- Corrected: ~302°C (7°C higher than uncorrected reading)

**Impact:**
- Using incorrect emissivity can result in temperature errors of 5-20°C
- Polished/clean rotors (ε = 0.60-0.70) may show significantly different readings
- Correction applied automatically to ALL brake temperature readings

#### 📖 Documentation Updates

- Updated `README.md` with brake sensor configuration section
- Updated `AI_CONTEXT.md` with emissivity correction details
- Added troubleshooting section for incorrect brake temperatures
- Enhanced inline code documentation in handler and config files
- Documented difference between tyre (Pico firmware) and brake (software) emissivity handling
- Clarified that MLX90640 tyre sensors apply emissivity via Pico firmware (0.95 for rubber)
- Explained why brake sensors use software correction (MLX90614/ADC default to ε = 1.0)

#### 🛡️ Security Fixes

- **CAN bus array access** - Restructured conditionals to check length before array access (obd2_handler.py)
- **Bare except clauses** - Replaced with specific exception types in unified_corner_handler.py
- **Input validation** - Added comprehensive validation to emissivity correction function
- **Thermal array validation** - Added second validation check in display.py
- **Division by zero prevention** - Added validation in brightness cycle handler
- **Display dimension validation** - Enhanced security checks for config file parsing
- **Emissivity bounds checking** - Validates emissivity values between 0.0 and 1.0

#### 🔧 Long Runtime Stability Features

- **Voltage monitoring** - Checks Pi power status at startup and every 60 seconds
  - Detects undervoltage and throttling conditions
  - Logs critical power issues with actionable recommendations
  - Historical tracking (issues that occurred since boot)
  - Live monitoring (issues happening right now)
- **Automatic garbage collection** - Runs every 60 seconds
  - Frees unreferenced Python objects
  - Logs collection statistics (objects collected/freed)
  - Prevents memory accumulation during extended runtime
- **pygame surface cache management** - Clears cached surfaces every 10 minutes
  - Prevents GPU memory buildup
  - No visible impact to user (no screen flicker)
  - Reduces pygame/SDL memory fragmentation

**Fixes 6-hour crash issue:**
- G-meter page would crash after ~6 hours of continuous operation
- Root cause 1: CAN message object leak in radar driver (30,000 Message objects/minute)
- Root cause 2: pygame/SDL memory fragmentation causing `display.flip()` to block (17+ seconds)
- Solution: Removed unused BufferedReader + Periodic GC + surface cache clearing

**Memory leak fix (toyota_radar_driver.py):**
- **Issue:** `can.BufferedReader()` was accumulating all CAN messages with no limit
- **Impact:** At 320 Hz radar rate, created 19,200+ Message objects/minute
- **Growth:** Object count grew from 83k to 4 million in 90 minutes
- **Fix:** Removed unused BufferedReader from Notifier (line 224-231)
- **Result:** Object count now stable at ~55k (±3-66/minute)
- **Verification:** Message objects no longer appear in top 10 object types
- **Memory profiling added:** Logs top object types and growth deltas every 60s

#### ⚡ Performance Optimisations

**Replaced manual list management with `collections.deque`**
- **Files modified:** `hardware/obd2_handler.py`, `hardware/ford_hybrid_handler.py`
- **Improvement:** O(n) → O(1) for rolling window operations
- **Details:**
  - OBD2 handler: Replaced `speed_history` and `map_history` list management
  - Ford Hybrid handler: Replaced `soc_history` list management
  - Used `deque(maxlen=N)` for automatic size limiting (no manual `pop(0)` needed)
  - Cleaner code with same functionality and better performance
  - Particularly beneficial for real-time sensor data smoothing at 2-5 Hz poll rates

**Before (O(n) operation):**
```python
self.speed_history = []
self.speed_history.append(speed)
if len(self.speed_history) > self.speed_history_size:
    self.speed_history.pop(0)  # O(n) - shifts all elements
```

**After (O(1) operation):**
```python
self.speed_history = deque(maxlen=5)
self.speed_history.append(speed)  # O(1) - auto-drops oldest
```

#### 🧪 Testing

- ✅ Emissivity correction applied to both ADC and MLX90614 brake sensors
- ✅ Invalid emissivity values (≤0 or >1.0) safely handled
- ✅ Default emissivity (1.0) returns uncorrected temperature
- ✅ Configuration properly documented with typical material values
- ✅ Voltage monitoring detects power issues on CM4-POE-UPS carrier
- ✅ Garbage collection runs every 60s, freeing 500-700 objects per cycle
- ✅ Surface cache clearing has no visible impact on display
- ✅ Deque optimisation maintains identical functionality with better performance

## [v0.9] - 2025-11-20

### Status Bars & OBD2 Simulation 📊

#### ✅ New Features
- **Application-level status bars** - Top and bottom bars visible on all pages
- **MAP-based SOC simulation** - Uses intake manifold pressure for desk testing without vehicle
- **Dynamic color coding** - Real-time visual feedback for charge/discharge state
- **Instant SOC updates** - Direct MAP-to-SOC mapping for responsive display
- **Clean camera transitions** - Stale frames cleared when switching away from camera
- **Correct front camera orientation** - Front camera shows normal view (not mirrored)

#### 🔄 Modified Files

- `main.py` - Moved status bars from gmeter to application level
  - Status bars now update on ALL pages, not just G-meter
  - Fixed status bar update logic (was only updating on gmeter page)
  - Added OBD2 MAP-based SOC with dynamic color zones
- `gui/gmeter.py` - Removed status bar code (moved to main.py)
  - Removed status bar initialization and rendering
  - Removed set_soc() and set_lap_delta() methods
- `hardware/obd2_handler.py` - Enhanced for SOC simulation
  - Added MAP (manifold absolute pressure) reading via PID 0x0B
  - Implemented direct MAP-to-SOC conversion (instant updates)
  - Reduced MAP history window from 10 to 3 samples for faster response
  - Fixed state calculation (increasing MAP = discharging, decreasing MAP = charging)
- `gui/camera.py` - Camera improvements
  - Clear last frame when stopping camera (prevents stale frame flash)
  - Conditional horizontal flip (rear camera only, not front)
- `ui/widgets/horizontal_bar.py` - Status bar widgets (no changes, used by main.py)

#### ⚙️ Configuration

**OBD2 Settings** (in `utils/config.py`):
```python
OBD_ENABLED = True              # Enable OBD2 speed and MAP reading
OBD_CHANNEL = "can_b2_1"        # CAN channel for OBD2 data
OBD_BITRATE = 500000            # Standard OBD2 bitrate (500 kbps)
```

**Status Bar Settings** (in `utils/config.py`):
```python
STATUS_BAR_ENABLED = True       # Show status bars at top and bottom
STATUS_BAR_HEIGHT = 20          # Height of status bars in pixels
```

#### 📊 Architecture

**Status Bars**
- **Top Bar**: Lap time delta (simulated for testing)
  - 🟢 Green = faster than reference lap
  - 🔴 Red = slower than reference lap
  - ⚪ Grey = same pace
- **Bottom Bar**: Battery State of Charge
  - 🔵 Blue = idle (steady throttle)
  - 🟢 Green = charging (throttle decreasing, MAP down, SOC up)
  - 🔴 Red = discharging (throttle increasing, MAP up, SOC down)

**MAP-to-SOC Mapping**
```python
# Direct mapping (instant updates)
MAP 20 kPa  → 100% SOC (minimum throttle)
MAP 30 kPa  → 87% SOC  (idle)
MAP 60 kPa  → 50% SOC  (moderate throttle)
MAP 100 kPa → 0% SOC   (wide open throttle)
```

**State Detection**
- Uses 3-sample rolling window for rate-of-change
- Threshold: ±0.3 kPa/reading for idle detection
- At 5Hz polling (200ms), 3 samples = 600ms averaging window

**Camera Behavior**
- **Rear camera**: Horizontally flipped (mirrored) for backing up
- **Front camera**: Normal view (not flipped) for road ahead
- **Frame clearing**: Last frame cleared when switching away from camera

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Status bars only updating on gmeter page** - Fixed by moving update logic outside page conditional
- **Slow SOC updates** - Changed from rate-of-change to direct mapping (instant response)
- **Incorrect SOC color states** - Fixed state calculation (MAP increasing = discharging = red)
- **Stale camera frame on reactivation** - Clear frame buffer when stopping camera
- **Front camera mirrored** - Only flip rear camera, not front

#### 🧪 Testing

- ✅ Status bars visible on all pages (telemetry, gmeter, camera)
- ✅ SOC updates instantly when MAP changes
- ✅ Colors correct (green=charging, red=discharging, blue=idle)
- ✅ Camera doesn't show stale frame after switching back
- ✅ Front camera shows normal view (not mirrored)
- ✅ Rear camera remains mirrored for backing up

#### 🎯 Use Cases

**Desk Testing**
- Connect to vehicle OBD2 port without driving
- Rev engine to see SOC bar change color instantly
- Idle: Blue bar at ~87% SOC
- Throttle up: Red bar, SOC decreases
- Throttle down: Green bar, SOC increases

**In-Vehicle Use** (future)
- Ford Hybrid SOC will replace simulated MAP-based SOC
- Same status bar interface, different data source
- Seamless transition from development to production

## [v0.8] - 2025-11-19

### Multi-Camera Support 🎥

#### ✅ New Features
- **Dual USB camera support** - Seamless switching between rear and front cameras
- **Deterministic camera identification** - Udev rules for consistent device naming across reboots
- **Smooth camera transitions** - No checkerboard flash during switching, freeze-frame transition
- **Proper resource management** - Only one camera initialized at a time to prevent conflicts
- **Dual FPS counters** - Shows both camera feed FPS and overall system FPS
- **Radar overlay on rear camera only** - Front camera displays clean video feed

#### 📦 New Files

```
config/
└── camera/
    └── 99-camera-names.rules      # Udev rules for persistent camera naming
```

#### 🔄 Modified Files

- `gui/camera.py` - Complete rewrite of camera switching logic
  - Added proper camera release before switching
  - Implemented freeze-frame transition to prevent checkerboard
  - Fixed test pattern override during transitions
  - Removed symlink resolution (use symlinks directly)
- `utils/config.py` - Added multi-camera configuration settings
- `README.md` - Added comprehensive multi-camera setup documentation
- `install.sh` - Added automatic camera udev rules installation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This entry

#### ⚙️ Configuration

**Multi-Camera Settings** (in `utils/config.py`):
```python
# Multi-camera configuration
CAMERA_REAR_ENABLED = True   # Rear camera (with radar overlay if radar enabled)
CAMERA_FRONT_ENABLED = True  # Front camera (no radar overlay)

# Camera device paths (if using udev rules for persistent naming)
CAMERA_REAR_DEVICE = "/dev/video-rear"   # or None for auto-detect
CAMERA_FRONT_DEVICE = "/dev/video-front"  # or None for auto-detect
```

**Udev Rules** (`config/camera/99-camera-names.rules`):
```bash
# Camera on USB port 1.1 = Rear camera
SUBSYSTEM=="video4linux", KERNELS=="1-1.1", ATTR{index}=="0", SYMLINK+="video-rear"

# Camera on USB port 1.2 = Front camera
SUBSYSTEM=="video4linux", KERNELS=="1-1.2", ATTR{index}=="0", SYMLINK+="video-front"
```

#### 🔧 Installation

The `install.sh` script now automatically installs camera udev rules:
```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

For manual installation:
```bash
sudo cp config/camera/99-camera-names.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

Verify symlinks:
```bash
ls -l /dev/video-*
# Should show:
# /dev/video-rear -> video0
# /dev/video-front -> video3
```

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed checkerboard during camera switching** - Implemented freeze-frame transition
- **Fixed resource conflicts** - Properly release old camera before initializing new one
- **Fixed test pattern override** - Only generate test pattern if no frame exists
- **Fixed deterministic identification** - Use udev symlinks directly without resolving to device paths

#### 📊 Architecture

**Camera Switching Flow**
1. Save last frame for smooth transition
2. Stop current camera capture thread
3. Release old camera device
4. Switch to new camera
5. Restore saved frame (prevents checkerboard)
6. Initialize new camera
7. Start capture thread for new camera

**USB Port Assignment**
- Rear camera → USB port 1.1 (creates `/dev/video-rear`)
- Front camera → USB port 1.2 (creates `/dev/video-front`)

Common USB port mappings on Raspberry Pi 4:
- `1-1.1` = Top-left USB 2.0 port
- `1-1.2` = Bottom-left USB 2.0 port
- `1-1.3` = Top-right USB 2.0 port
- `1-1.4` = Bottom-right USB 2.0 port

#### 🧪 Testing

- ✅ Both cameras initialize correctly
- ✅ Camera switching works in all directions (telemetry ↔ rear ↔ front)
- ✅ No checkerboard flash during transitions
- ✅ Deterministic identification survives reboots
- ✅ Radar overlay only appears on rear camera
- ✅ Dual FPS counters display correctly
- ✅ Resource management prevents conflicts

#### 🎯 Controls

- **Button 2** (or **Spacebar**): Cycle through views
  - Telemetry → Rear Camera → Front Camera → Telemetry
- Camera switching is seamless with smooth freeze-frame transitions
- FPS counters show camera feed performance
