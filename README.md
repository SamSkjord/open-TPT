## Configuration

### Display Configuration

openTPT is designed for 800x480 resolution and scales to other display sizes. To configure your display:

1. Run the configuration utility:
   ```
   python3 configure_display.py
   ```

2. Options:
   - Show current settings: `python3 configure_display.py --show`
   - Auto-detect resolution: `python3 configure_display.py --detect`
   - Set resolution manually: `python3 configure_display.py --width 1280 --height 720`

The display settings are stored in `display_config.json` in the project root directory.

### System Configuration

Hardware and system constants are in `utils/config.py`:
- I2C addresses and bus settings
- CAN channels and bitrates
- Display dimensions and font paths
- Colour thresholds for temperature and pressure
- Default values for user preferences

### User Settings (Persistent)

User preferences changed via the on-screen menu are saved to `~/.opentpt_settings.json` and persist across restarts:
- **Units**: Temperature (C/F), Pressure (PSI/BAR/kPa), Speed (km/h/mph)
- **Camera**: Mirror and rotation for front/rear cameras
- **Display**: Brightness level
- **Radar**: Enabled/disabled state
- **Speed source**: OBD or GPS

Settings are saved immediately when changed. If the file doesn't exist, defaults from `config.py` are used.

### Tyre Sensor Configuration

openTPT supports per-tyre sensor type configuration, allowing you to mix Pico I2C slave modules (with MLX90640 thermal cameras) and MLX90614 single-point IR sensors.

**Emissivity Note:** Pico modules with MLX90640 sensors have emissivity pre-configured in the Pico firmware (default 0.95 for rubber tyres, configurable via I2C register). This is applied during temperature calculation on the Pico itself, not in openTPT.

Edit `utils/config.py` and configure the `TYRE_SENSOR_TYPES` dictionary:

```python
TYRE_SENSOR_TYPES = {
    "FL": "pico",      # Front Left - Pico module with MLX90640
    "FR": "pico",      # Front Right - Pico module with MLX90640
    "RL": "mlx90614",  # Rear Left - MLX90614 single-point IR
    "RR": "mlx90614",  # Rear Right - MLX90614 single-point IR
}
```

**Sensor type options:**
- `"pico"` - Raspberry Pi Pico I2C slave module with MLX90640 thermal camera
  - Provides detailed thermal imaging with left/centre/right zone data
  - Requires pico-tyre-temp firmware on the Pico
  - Connected via I2C multiplexer (TCA9548A)

- `"mlx90614"` - MLX90614 single-point IR temperature sensor
  - Simpler, lower-cost alternative
  - Single temperature reading per tyre
  - Connected via I2C multiplexer (TCA9548A)

**I2C multiplexer channel assignments:**

Configure channels for each sensor type in `utils/config.py`:

```python
# Pico I2C slave modules (MLX90640 thermal cameras)
PICO_MUX_CHANNELS = {
    "FL": 0,  # Front Left on channel 0
    "FR": 1,  # Front Right on channel 1
    "RL": 2,  # Rear Left on channel 2
    "RR": 3,  # Rear Right on channel 3
}

# MLX90614 single-point IR sensors
MLX90614_MUX_CHANNELS = {
    "FL": 0,  # Front Left on channel 0
    "FR": 1,  # Front Right on channel 1
    "RL": 2,  # Rear Left on channel 2
    "RR": 3,  # Rear Right on channel 3
}
```

**Note:** Both sensor types can share the same channel numbers if they're not used on the same positions. For example, if FL/FR use Pico modules on channels 0/1, and RL/RR use MLX90614 sensors, they can also use channels 0/1 (or 2/3).

### Brake Temperature Sensor Configuration

openTPT supports per-corner brake sensor type configuration with automatic emissivity correction for accurate temperature readings.

#### Sensor Types

Edit `utils/config.py` to configure the `BRAKE_SENSOR_TYPES` dictionary:

```python
BRAKE_SENSOR_TYPES = {
    "FL": "mlx90614",  # Front Left - MLX90614 IR sensor
    "FR": "adc",       # Front Right - ADC IR sensor
    "RL": "adc",       # Rear Left - ADC IR sensor
    "RR": "adc",       # Rear Right - ADC IR sensor
}
```

**Sensor type options:**
- `"mlx90614"` - MLX90614 single-point IR sensor via I2C multiplexer
- `"adc"` - IR sensor via ADS1115 ADC (4 channels available)
- `"obd"` - CAN/OBD-II (rarely available, most vehicles don't broadcast brake temps)

#### Emissivity Correction

**All IR sensors assume perfect black body emissivity (ε = 1.0) by default.** Since brake rotors have lower emissivity (typically 0.95 for oxidised cast iron), the sensors will read lower than actual temperature. openTPT automatically applies software emissivity correction to compensate.

**Note on Tyre vs Brake Emissivity Handling:**
- **Tyre sensors (MLX90640 via Pico):** Emissivity is configured in the Pico firmware (default 0.95 for rubber) and applied during temperature calculation by the MLX90640 API. No additional correction needed in openTPT.
- **Brake sensors (MLX90614/ADC):** Sensors use factory default ε = 1.0, so openTPT applies software correction to compensate for actual rotor emissivity (typically 0.95 for cast iron).

Both approaches achieve the same result - accurate temperature readings - using different implementation methods appropriate to each sensor type.

**How it works:**
1. MLX90614/IR sensor has factory default ε = 1.0 (not changed in hardware)
2. Actual brake rotor has lower emissivity (e.g., ε = 0.95)
3. Sensor reads lower than actual due to less radiation from non-black-body surface
4. Software correction adjusts reading upward: `T_actual = T_measured / ε^0.25`

Configure per-corner emissivity values in `utils/config.py`:

```python
BRAKE_ROTOR_EMISSIVITY = {
    "FL": 0.95,  # Front Left - typical oxidised cast iron
    "FR": 0.95,  # Front Right
    "RL": 0.95,  # Rear Left
    "RR": 0.95,  # Rear Right
}
```

**Typical rotor emissivity values:**
- Cast iron (rusty/oxidised): **0.95** (most common, recommended default)
- Cast iron (machined/clean): 0.60-0.70
- Steel (oxidised): 0.80
- Steel (polished): 0.15-0.25
- Ceramic composite: 0.90-0.95

**Note:** Adjust the values to match your specific rotor materials. Using incorrect emissivity values can result in temperature errors of 5-20°C. The correction is applied automatically by the unified corner handler to all brake temperature readings.

### Multi-Camera Configuration

openTPT supports dual USB cameras for rear and front views with seamless switching. The system uses udev rules to provide deterministic camera identification based on USB port location.

#### Hardware Setup

1. Connect cameras to specific USB ports:
   - **Rear camera** → USB port 1.1 (creates `/dev/video-rear`)
   - **Front camera** → USB port 1.2 (creates `/dev/video-front`)

2. Enable cameras in `utils/config.py`:
   ```python
   # Multi-camera configuration
   CAMERA_REAR_ENABLED = True   # Rear camera (with radar overlay if radar enabled)
   CAMERA_FRONT_ENABLED = True  # Front camera (no radar overlay)

   # Camera device paths (if using udev rules for persistent naming)
   CAMERA_REAR_DEVICE = "/dev/video-rear"   # or None for auto-detect
   CAMERA_FRONT_DEVICE = "/dev/video-front"  # or None for auto-detect
   ```

#### Udev Rules Setup

To ensure cameras are correctly identified regardless of boot order, create udev rules:

1. Create `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-camera-names.rules` on your Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   # Camera on USB port 1.1 = Rear camera
   SUBSYSTEM=="video4linux", KERNELS=="1-1.1", ATTR{index}=="0", SYMLINK+="video-rear"

   # Camera on USB port 1.2 = Front camera
   SUBSYSTEM=="video4linux", KERNELS=="1-1.2", ATTR{index}=="0", SYMLINK+="video-front"
   ```

2. Reload udev rules:
   ```bash
   sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
   sudo udevadm trigger
   ```

3. Verify symlinks exist:
   ```bash
   ls -l /dev/video-*
   ```

   You should see:
   ```
   /dev/video-rear -> video0
   /dev/video-front -> video3
   ```
   (Actual device numbers may vary, but symlinks will always be consistent)

#### Finding USB Port Paths

To identify which USB port corresponds to which kernel path:

1. List USB devices with their kernel paths:
   ```bash
   for dev in /dev/video*; do
     udevadm info --query=all --name=$dev | grep -E "DEVNAME|KERNELS"
   done
   ```

2. Or use the system tree:
   ```bash
   ls -la /sys/bus/usb/devices/
   ```

Common USB port mappings on Raspberry Pi 4:
- `1-1.1` = Top-left USB 2.0 port
- `1-1.2` = Bottom-left USB 2.0 port
- `1-1.3` = Top-right USB 2.0 port
- `1-1.4` = Bottom-right USB 2.0 port

**Note:** USB 3.0 ports use different kernel paths (e.g., `2-1`, `2-2`). Adjust the udev rules accordingly if using USB 3.0 ports.

#### Camera Switching Behavior

- Press Button 2 (or Spacebar) to cycle through views: Telemetry → Rear Camera → Front Camera → Telemetry
- When radar is enabled, the overlay only appears on the rear camera view
- Camera switching is seamless with smooth frame transitions (no checkerboard flash)
- Dual FPS counters show both camera feed FPS and overall system FPS

### Radar Configuration

The Toyota radar overlay is now **enabled by default** and displays collision warnings on the rear camera.

#### Hardware Setup

1. **Waveshare Dual CAN HAT** (Board 1):
   - CAN_0 connector (can_b1_0): Car keep-alive messages (TX to radar)
   - CAN_1 connector (can_b1_1): Radar track output (RX from radar)

2. **Toyota Radar Module** (Prius/Corolla 2017+):
   - Connect to both CAN buses as per wiring diagram
   - Radar will output ~320 Hz track messages

#### Software Configuration

The radar is configured in `utils/config.py`:

```python
# Enable/disable radar overlay
RADAR_ENABLED = True  # Now enabled by default

# CAN channel configuration (for Waveshare Dual CAN HAT)
RADAR_CHANNEL = "can_b1_1"  # Radar outputs tracks here
CAR_CHANNEL = "can_b1_0"    # Keep-alive sent here
RADAR_INTERFACE = "socketcan"
RADAR_BITRATE = 500000

# DBC files (included in opendbc/ directory)
RADAR_DBC = "opendbc/toyota_prius_2017_adas.dbc"
CONTROL_DBC = "opendbc/toyota_prius_2017_pt_generated.dbc"

# Display parameters
RADAR_CAMERA_FOV = 106.0           # Camera field of view (degrees)
RADAR_TRACK_COUNT = 3              # Number of tracks to display
RADAR_MAX_DISTANCE = 120.0         # Maximum distance (metres)
RADAR_WARN_YELLOW_KPH = 10.0       # Yellow warning threshold
RADAR_WARN_RED_KPH = 20.0          # Red warning threshold
```

#### Dependencies

Install cantools for DBC file parsing:
```bash
pip3 install --break-system-packages cantools
```

Or install all dependencies from requirements.txt:
```bash
pip3 install --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt
```

#### Visual Display

When enabled, the radar overlay shows on the **rear camera only**:
- 🟢 **Green chevrons**: Vehicle detected, safe distance (<10 km/h closing)
- 🟡 **Yellow chevrons**: Moderate closing speed (10-20 km/h)
- 🔴 **Red chevrons**: Rapid approach (>20 km/h closing speed)
- 🔵 **Blue side arrows**: Overtaking vehicle warning
- **Distance and speed text**: Range in metres and relative velocity

Chevrons are **3x larger (120×108px) and solid-filled** for high visibility.
