# Persistent CAN interface naming for dual Waveshare 2-CH CAN HAT+ stack
#
# This ensures CAN interfaces always have consistent names regardless of
# kernel probe order, based on their physical SPI bus and chip select.
#
# Physical mapping:
#   can_b1_0 = Board 1 (bottom), CAN_0 connector (spi1.1, GPIO22 interrupt)
#   can_b1_1 = Board 1 (bottom), CAN_1 connector (spi1.2, GPIO13 interrupt)
#   can_b2_0 = Board 2 (top),    CAN_0 connector (spi0.0, GPIO23 interrupt)
#   can_b2_1 = Board 2 (top),    CAN_1 connector (spi0.1, GPIO25 interrupt) <- OBD-II
